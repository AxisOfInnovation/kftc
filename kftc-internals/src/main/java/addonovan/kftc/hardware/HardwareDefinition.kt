     * Simple function to get all types of hardware by parameterization.
     *
     * This method will return the correct device from the hardware device mappings
     * in the HardwareMap by using the parameterized type and the name given.
     * This can also create hardware extension classes on the go as well, so
     * long as they are valid.
     *
     * This will return a lazy initializer which will get the hardware device
     * on its first access, and so properties using this must be written like so:
     * ```kotlin
     * val motorLeft by get< DcMotor >( "motor_left" );
     * ```

     * @param[T]
     *          The type of hardware device to get.
     * @param[name]
     *          The name of the hardware device to return.
     *
     * @return A lazy initializer for the hardware device with the given
     *          type, [T], and the name, [name].
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     *          If [T] had no DeviceMapping associated with it (i.e. no valid
     *          Hardware Extension and no way to get it out of [HardwareMap].
     * @throws NullPointerException
